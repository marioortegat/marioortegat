# Hi, I'm Mario Ortega 👋

I build production-grade AI systems and ship MLOps templates that Senior Engineers and companies can deploy right away.

My work is hands-on: clean code, clear patterns, and robust architecture across the full GenAI stack: from model tuning to scalable deployment.

I am focused on delivering high-impact, open-source solutions that help teams bypass the research phase and go straight to scalable deployment.

***

### What I Work On

My expertise covers the full modern GenAI pipeline, ensuring systems are both powerful and production-ready:

* **AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems:** Building robust, specialized agents capable of planning, tool use, and complex sequential tasks.
* **Production RAG Architectures:** Designing highly scalable RAG systems with advanced techniques (hybrid search, multi-hop, and retrieval optimization).
* **LLM Fine-Tuning & Custom Models:** Deep expertise in **LoRA, QLoRA, and Full Fine-Tuning** of open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Gemma).
* **Vector Databases & Search:** Hands-on optimization of vector stores, indexing strategies, and embedding generation for high-performance retrieval.
* **MLOps & Scalability:** Creating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates for fast, production-ready deployment of LLMs and AI services.
* **Video & Multimodal Processing:** Developing pipelines for visual data handling, including video analysis and processing for multimodal GenAI applications.
* **Expert Content:** Full-code tutorials and technical guides on GenAI best practices.
